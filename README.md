# Combat Tracker

Combat Tracker is a tool that I built for a Final Project for one of my school classes. I decided to build this application to help me when I am running Dungeons and Dragons campaigns with my friends. 

## How To Use

#### Initiative
When starting fresh, you will have no Player Characters (PCs) or Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in your initiative order. When your PCs enter a combat situation they will need to roll an Initiative roll and the Dungeon Master (DM / me) will roll an Initiative roll for the NPCs. At this point you will use the Initiative Tracker to enter the information as needed. Select PC or NPC. This will give you a lost of either PCs to pick from or DnD monsters as your NPCs. Also input their Initiative Roll and click Add to Initiative. The app will add the players to the order and sort the order based on their Initiative Rolls. 

#### Combat
When you are ready to start combat, click the Next Initiative button. This will display the character of who's turn it is. That player will have his/her turn to take their actions. If a player makes an attack, you can track that with the Damage Tracker. Follow the input fields and fill in as much information as required/desired.  When your fields are entered, click the Add Damage button at the bottom and the app will add automatically pull the player information from the initiative tracker and add the appropriate information to the player. 

#### Scoreboard
As campaigns continue, discussions arise of who had done the most work in combat. This scoreboard will track your PCs through the campaign and display the amount of Damage that they have inflicted onto enemies as well as how many foes they have delivered their killing blow to. As you enter damage in the Damage Tracker, the Scoreboard will update automatically.
